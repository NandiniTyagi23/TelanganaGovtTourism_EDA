Telangana is one of India’s leading states and has published its tourism data under its open data policy.

As a data analyst, Peter Pandey saw this as an opportunity to expand his skills and show his work on a bigger scale. Peter Pandey’s idea is to find the patterns in the given data, do additional research, and give data-informed recommendations to the Telangana government which can be used to increase their revenue by improving administrative operations.
